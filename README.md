# RL-Course
The course is based on [David Silver's RL Course](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/). During the 8-week course, you will become versed in basic knowledge and algorithm implementation for RL. Additionally, the in-class quizzes will help you practice existing knowlegde. Through multiple hands-on assignments and two final course projects, you will acquire the programming details and practical engineering tricks for training in DRL.
